Project containing some tests for fun and/or verify other projects:
- A java 8 primer
- My beloved and unfinished Mercurious project
- Scheduling with Quartz
- Some main programs to test:
	· Threads
	· Logs
	· JodaTime
	· Encoding
	· Random
	· Runtime
	· Arrays
	· Threads
	· More times
- Of course, some Spring beans
- URLFactory for Tomcat

Note: it uses Java SE 7, since there is no support for Java 8 for the time being.
